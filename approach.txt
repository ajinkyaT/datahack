1. Download data
2. Do basic EDA
3. Use autogluon built in feature engineering for categorical variables
4. Use 5 k-fold validation for model building
5. Use Random Forest, Extra trees, XGB, LGB, Catboost, and KNN models in each level of 3 stack
6. Keep the best model and its ancestors and discard model utilities and unused models for faster inference with no drop in accuracy
